# put.io client

This is a put.io client for the command line, written in Python.

## Features

 - Browse your put.io storage
 - Download individual files
 - Recursively download a directory and its contents, reproducing the structure locally
 - Delete files/folders
 - Create directories
 - Add transfers from URL(s)
 - Resumable downloads

## Installation

Set up the file `~/.config/putio-cli/config`, with the following contents:

    [api]
    key=YOUR_API_KEY
    secret=YOUR_API_SECRET

    [download]
    user=YOUR_PUTIO_USERNAME
    password=YOUR_PUTIO_PASSWORD
    limitrate=0

The `[download]` section is optional, and is used only to retrieve files. If
you do not download files using `putio-cli`, then you don't need to fill this
section in. 
You can add limiting bandwith with curl. If 0 it is not limited. The value is in bytes.

## Commands

The various subcommands are shown below:

 - `putio-cli info` displays information about your account, including available/total disk space and bandwidth
 - `putio-cli add <url> [<url>...]` will tell put.io to download from one or more URLs (either files or torrents)
 - `putio-cli add` accepts text containing one or more URLs on standard input, and instructs put.io to download them all
 - `putio-cli ls <path>` displays an `ls`-style directory listing of the given path
 - `putio-cli geturl <file>` displays the download URL for the given file
 - `putio-cli get <file>` downloads the file to the current directory
 - `putio-cli get <dir>` downloads the entire remote directory and all of its contents to a subfolder of the current directory
 - `putio-cli mkdir <path>` creates the given directory on put.io
 - `putio-cli rm <path>` deletes the given remote path **WITHOUT CONFIRMATION**.

## Examples

    # Download a single file to the current directory
    putio-cli get '/Films/My.Favourite.Film.avi'

    # Download an entire directory, creating "Some Show" and everything below
    # it inside the current directory
    putio-cli get '/TV/Some Show'
    # ... later ...
    ls './Some Show/'
    # your files and folders

## Bugs and Limitations

 - No support for moving/renaming files or folders (yet)
 - Not very user-friendly to set up
 - When resuming a file download, it doesn't tell you how much has been completed already -- just how much is left
 - Only supports downloading to the current directory
 - Fairly poor error handling
